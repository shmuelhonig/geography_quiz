This project is a fill-in-the-blank geography quiz. It was originally created as part of Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree program, and has since been updated to further improve the code quality.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository from GitHub: https://github.com/shmuelhonig/geography_quiz.git
2. Run geography_quiz.py from the command line. Note that Python version 2.7 is required to run the program.
